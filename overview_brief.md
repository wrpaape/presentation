# OpenCyc-Jumble Saga
### Tears of a Spoon-fed Baby Dev

## Drawn Conclusions
1. OpenCyc is **_NOT_** Cyc
2. OpenCyc is **_NOT_** an out-of-the-box "plugin" solution
3. Building a **_BASIC_** OpenCyc application requires technical know-how in:
  - Ontological Development
  - Java ()
  - RDF (XML, OWL)




## Community
- no (active) centralized place for discussion
- most academic and/or well versed in "Ontological Development"
- most (constructive) help threads flavored:
  a. "highly"-technical (things not mentioned directly in the tutorials) discussion
  b. issues with setup/installation
- for better or for worse, lacking a (vocal) newblood presence

## Wish I had found sooner:
1. [OpenCyc as a Database ~2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20090618141755/http://www.dapissarenko.com/resources/2005_09_30_ordus/#12)
  - easy-reading, unfortunately one-of-a-kind complete walk-through for constructing a simple app using OpenCyc with the Java API
2. [Guyren Howe SDRuby Podcast ~2010](http://video.sdruby.org/video/076_opencyc.m4v)
  - one-of-a-kind video demo of OpenCyc functionality beyond simple assertion/query
    - retrieves PrettyStrings "(HotDog Dog)" from "dog"
  - "Cyc for ordinary mortals"
    - smarter searching and classification
    - framework for developing ontologies
  - demo of ruby wrapper for Java API
3. [HD Video Demo of Basic KB Browser Assertion and Query](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~vjalalib/OpenCyc.swf)
4. [OpenCyc Forums](http://sourceforge.net/p/opencyc/discussion/)
5. Misc Lectures:
  a. [Free Semantic Content: Using OpenCyc in Semantic Web Applications](http://videolectures.net/iswc08_witbrock_fsc/)
  b. [Teaching Cyc to Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84B_AgyUDIU)
  c. OpenCyc Commonsense AI Tutorial ~ 2009
    1. [Part 1](https://vimeo.com/6579522)
    2. [Part 2](https://vimeo.com/6595854)

## Would like to see:
1. application-development-oriented tutorials
2. application-development-oriented walk-throughs
3. POC demo of functionality exclusive to or best implemented by OpenCyc
4. comprehensive lists of:
  a. prerequisite tools and knowledge for:
    1. effective employment of the KB browser
    2. basic communication with API
    3. effective employment of the API
    4. development of a full-stack, knowledge-based app
  b. links to open-source OpenCyc apps
